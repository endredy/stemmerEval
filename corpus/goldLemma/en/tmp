Four
men
and
a
shoebox
start
a
beer
revolution

THE
idea
for
a
beer
drinkers
'
protection
movement
came
to
four
young
men
holidaying
in
Ireland
in
1971

They
were
rejoicing
in
the
splendid
Irish
Guinness
they
drank
and
bemoaned
the
sad
state
of
beer
back
in
Britain

In
those
days
the
major
brewers
were
busily
promoting
keg
beer
a
chilled
filtered
and
pasteurised
apology
for
traditional
draught
beer

Keg
was
given
massive
promotion
and
the
success
of
such
brands
as
Double
Diamond
and
Worthington
E
was
forcing
independent
brewers
to
switch
to
keg
production
too

There
was
a
real
fear
that
cask
ale
Britain
's
unique
contribution
to
the
world
of
beer
could
be
drowned
in
a
rising
tide
of
cold
fizzy
keg

Michael
Hardman
Graham
Lees
Bill
Mellor
and
Jim
Makin
decided
to
launch
CAMRA
which
stood
at
first
for
the
Campaign
for
the
Revitalisation
of
Ale

Hardman
Lees
and
Mellor
were
professional
journalists

They
were
able
to
drum
up
a
great
deal
of
press
and
radio
material
on
the
sorry
plight
of
British
beer

When
the
first
CAMRA
annual
meeting
was
held
in
1972
the
event
was
given
wide
media
coverage
and
thousands
flocked
to
join
the
new
organisation

At
first
CAMRA
was
run
on
a
purely
voluntary
basis
controlled
by
an
elected
national
executive

Graham
Lees
was
the
honorary
secretary
and
kept
the
national
records
in
an
old
shoe
box

Michael
Hardman
edited
a
monthly
newsletter
called
What
's
Brewing
produced
on
a
typewriter
and
edited
and
pasted
on
a
kitchen
table

But
the
demands
of
a
growing
membership
were
outstripping
the
voluntary
nature
of
the
Campaign

An
office
was
rented
in
St
Albans
and
a
small
staff
was
appointed
with
Michael
Hardman
as
the
first
editor
of
publications
responsible
for
both
What
's
Brewing
and
the
new
and
immediately
successful
Good
Beer
Guide
which
listed
all
the
known
outlets
for
real
ale

By
the
late
1970s
CAMRA
now
known
as
the
Campaign
for
Real
Ale
had
more
than
28,000
members

Its
presence
had
at
first
been
derided
by
the
national
brewers
but
its
campaigning
zeal
attracted
continual
media
attention
and
many
independent
brewers
had
been
encouraged
to
return
to
cask
beer
production
with
enthusiasm

By
the
time
CAMRA
celebrated
its
first
ten
years
it
could
pride
itself
on
a
large
national
membership
and
a
series
of
hardhitting
reports
that
had
exposed
the
market
domination
of
the
big
brewers
and
the
shoddy
beers
they
produced

The
drinking
public
was
now
aware
they
were
being
taken
for
a
ride
by
the
brewing
barons

They
were
being
overcharged
for
third-rate
beer
much
of
it
brewed
from
cheap
and
inferior
ingredients

It
was
beer
that
was
forced
on
the
public
as
a
result
of
expensive
advertising

In
many
parts
of
the
country
there
was
little
choice
for
drinkers
as
the
big
brewers
owned
most
of
the
pubs
as
a
result
of
the
takeover
and
closure
of
scores
of
independent
brewers

There
was
still
much
to
do
to
ensure
greater
choice
and
better
quality
for
drinkers

But
beer
lovers
now
had
a
national
movement
that
was
dedicated
to
fighting
on
their
behalf

CAMRA

It
's
a
piece
of
cake

Jim
Makin
Bill
Mellor
Michael
Hardman
and
Graham
Lees
celebrate
the
first
10
years

The
first
edition
in
1972

Saving
our
pub
heritage

YOU
ca
n't
enjoy
good
beer
if
the
pubs
that
serve
them
are
badly
run
or
have
been
modernised
in
a
vulgar
and
insensitive
fashion

CAMRA
's
Pubs
Group
involves
planners
and
architects
in
its
work
to
preserve
the
quality
of
British
pubs

It
is
not
against
modernisation
but
believes
that
pubs
should
cater
for
all
tastes

The
group
organises
the
annual
pub
awards
given
to
brewers
or
free
traders
who
have
built
or
refurbished
houses
to
a
high
standard

Keg
the
quick
and
the
dead

There
is
a
major
difference
between
real
ale
and
keg
beer

Keg
which
includes
lager
is
known
in
the
industry
as
brewery
conditioned
beer

Instead
of
a
secondary
fermentation
in
the
cask
to
add
a
full
mature
palate
keg
beers
are
killed
off
in
the
brewery
by
filtration
chilling
and
pasteurisation

The
aim
is
to
produce
beers
that
are
sterile
have
a
long
shelf
life
and
are
highly
profitable

In
the
case
of
keg
milds
and
bitters
when
fermentation
is
complete
they
are
conditioned
for
a
short
period
under
gas
pressure
and
are
then
filtered
to
remove
yeast
solids
and
pasteurised

As
the
beer
can
not
generate
its
own
carbon
dioxide
it
would
be
flat
and
lifeless
so
it
is
racked
not
into
casks
but
into
pressurised
containers
known
as
kegs

In
the
pub
cellar
the
kegs
are
connected
to
gas
cylinders
and
the
gas
pushes
the
chilled
beer
to
the
bar

Lager
is
Britain
's
insipid
apology
for
the
fine
beers
perfected
by
master
brewers
in
such
great
brewing
countries
as
Germany
and
Czechoslovakia

Such
beers
as
a
Czech
Pilsner
or
a
German
Munchener
are
rich
and
complex
beers
brewed
with
pale
malts
special
hop
varieties
and
a
bottom-fermenting
yeast
strain
which
works
at
much
lower
temperatures
than
ale
yeast

British
lager
is
weak
the
Whitbread
version
of
Heineken
is
12°
weaker
than
the
original
Dutch
version
gassy
and
served
ice-cold
to
mask
its
lack
of
flavour

British
lagers
are
rarely
stored
from
the
German
word
lagered
for
the
period
needed
to
develop
taste

CAMRA
is
concerned
that
inferior
beers
like
keg
bitter
and
lager
are
foisted
on
a
public
unaware
of
the
inferior
ingredients
used
in
their
production

The
brewers
of
these
beers
want
to
produce
them
as
fast
as
possible
and
use
chemical
additives
to
speed
up
fermentation
cut
down
on
yeast
head
to
get
more
liquid
into
the
fermenters
and
to
produce
a
beer
with
a
thick
head
of
foam

These
beers
are
also
made
with
substantial
levels
of
adjuncts
to
the
malt
mash
maize
rice
triticale
wheat
flour
and
potato
starch

British
brewers
do
not
have
to
declare
the
ingredients
they
use
but
when
American
consumers
ran
a
check
of
Miller
Lite
they
found
it
contained
corn
syrup
propylene
glycol
alginate
papain
enzymes
and
potassium
metabisulphite

Cask
ale
unique
beer
of
the
world

Real
ale
or
cask-conditioned
beer
to
give
it
the
correct
technical
name
is
the
champagne
of
the
beer
world
a
beer
that
reaches
maturity
inside
its
container
in
the
pub
cellar

It
is
that
conditioning
in
the
cask
that
marks
it
out
from
the
rest
of
the
world
's
beers

The
rest
of
the
world
drinks
mainly
lager
beers
and
even
in
countries
such
as
Belgium
where
ale-type
beers
are
produced
they
come
to
fruition
in
the
bottle
rather
than
in
the
cask

The
British
drink
most
of
their
beer
in
draught
rather
than
bottled
form

A
cask
ale
is
brewed
from
the
finest
malting
barley
produced
in
the
main
in
East
Anglia
with
the
addition
of
English
hop
varieties

Before
barley
can
be
used
in
a
brewery
it
must
be
turned
into
malt

This
requires
great
skill
in
encouraging
the
barley
to
germinate
producing
the
natural
starches
that
will
provide
sugar
for
fermentation

In
a
maltings
the
grain
is
allowed
to
germinate
with
roots
breaking
through
the
husk
of
the
barley
and
is
then
heated
in
a
kiln
to
produce
a
pale
or
darker
malt
according
to
the
brewer
's
needs

In
the
brewery
the
malt
is
ground
into
a
coarse
powder
called
grist

It
is
thoroughly
mixed
in
a
large
vessel
called
a
mash
tun
with
hot
pure
water

The
sugars
dissolve
into
the
water
and
the
sweet
liquid
called
wort
is
pumped
to
a
copper

The
flowers
of
the
hop
plant
add
bitterness
to
beer
and
the
oils
in
the
plant
also
guard
against
any
infections
during
the
brewing
process

As
the
wort
is
boiled
in
the
copper
with
the
hops
many
brewers
also
add
sugars
such
as
glucose
or
cereal
syrup
to
encourage
a
strong
fermentation

CAMRA
would
prefer
beer
to
be
brewed
solely
from
barley
malt
but
the
use
of
sugar
dates
back
to
the
19th
century
and
many
renowned
beers
such
as
Marston
's
Pedigree
have
recipes
that
include
10
per
cent
or
more
brewing
sugars

When
the
hopped
wort
has
been
cooled
it
is
run
to
fermenting
vessels
where
it
meets
its
destiny
with
yeast

The
type
of
yeast
strain
used
for
ale
is
known
as
top
fermenting

It
works
at
a
warm
temperature
and
vigorously
turns
the
sugars
in
the
wort
into
alcohol
and
carbon
dioxide
producing
at
the
same
time
ripe
fruity
aromas
that
add
to
the
pleasure
of
ale
drinking

The
great
head
of
yeast
created
during
fermentation
is
cropped
off
and
after
a
week
the
remaining
yeast
is
overcome
by
the
alcohol
it
has
produced
and
sinks
to
the
bottom
of
the
fermenter

The
liquid
is
now
officially
called
beer
but
it
needs
a
few
days
further
conditioning
in
the
brewery
to
purge
some
of
the
rough
alcohols
before
it
is
ready
to
leave
for
the
pub

The
beer
is
run
into
casks

Brewers
may
add
sugar
to
encourage
a
strong
secondary
fermentation
and
also
additional
hops
to
give
the
finished
beer
a
pleasant
hoppy
aroma

Finings
a
glutinous
liquid
made
from
the
swim
bladder
of
the
sturgeon
is
also
added
this
slowly
clears
the
beer
of
its
yeasty
deposits

It
is
in
the
pub
cellar
that
the
beers
reaches
maturity

The
remaining
yeast
in
the
casks
turns
the
residual
sugars
into
alcohol
while
the
natural
gas
produced
escapes
through
a
soft
porous
wooden
peg
knocked
into
the
shive
hole
on
top
of
the
cask

When
a
vigorous
secondary
fermentation
begins
to
die
down
the
soft
peg
is
replaced
with
a
hard
one
to
keep
the
gas
inside
the
cask
which
gives
the
beer
a
natural
sparkle
in
the
glass

Two
days
after
reaching
the
pub
the
beer
is
ready
to
be
served

Plastic
tubes
or
lines
are
connected
to
the
tap
in
the
cask
and
a
pump
known
as
a
beer
engine
or
an
electric
pump
draws
beer
from
the
cask
to
the
bar

As
the
beer
has
been
vented
and
is
open
to
the
atmosphere
each
cask
must
be
sold
within
three
or
four
days
to
stop
the
beer
becoming
oxidised

A
vented
cask

Turn
off
the
gas
good
beer
needs
no
blanket

Real
ale
is
a
natural
product
that
should
be
served
by
the
natural
methods
described
above

It
can
be
spoilt
if
publicans
serve
it
by
unnatural
methods

In
order
to
prolong
the
life
of
a
cask
some
publicans
connect
a
cylinder
of
carbon
dioxide
to
the
shive
hole
and
cover
the
beer
with
a
blanket
of
gas

In
extreme
cases
the
gas
pressure
is
used
to
force
the
beer
to
the
bar

The
end
result
is
an
immature
beer
that
has
not
been
allowed
to
breathe
and
condition
in
the
cask
and
which
tastes
flat
and
gassy
in
the
glass

In
some
pubs
fake
hand
pumps
serve
gassy
beer

In
recent
years
some
brewers
have
started
to
use
a
cask
breather
a
simple
demand
valve
connected
to
a
cask
and
a
CO2
cylinder
which
maintains
the
gas
pressure
inside
the
cask
as
the
beer
is
drawn
off

It
is
a
system
opposed
by
CAMRA
as
it
interferes
with
the
natural
processes
of
beer
maturation

Pressurised

CAMRA
has
produced
a
series
of

the
Campaign

is

of
the

Top
ales
that
have
n't
lost
their
bottle

A
handful
of
beers
brewed
in
Britain
still
mature
in
the
bottle
as
draught
beer
does
in
the
cask

They
have
to
be
poured
with
caution
and
skill
to
keep
the
slight
yeast
sediment
out
of
the
glass
and
the
publican
has
to
rotate
his
stock
carefully
to
make
sure
the
beer
is
served
when
it
is
in
the
peak
of
condition

The
most
widely
available
bottled-conditioned
beer
is
Worthington
White
Shield
brewed
by
Bass
in
Sheffield

It
is
the
original
India
Pale
Ale
that
made
Burton
the
brewing
centre
of
Britain

The
version
of
Guinness
sold
in
crown
corked
bottles
in
pubs
in
England
and
Wales
is
naturally
conditioned

Courage
's
Imperial
Russian
Stout
has
a
powerful
gravity
of
1108°

The
name
stems
from
the
fact
that
it
was
once
exported
to
imperial
Russia
where
it
was
popular
with
the
Czarist
court

Thomas
Hardy
's
Ale
brewed
by
Eldridge
Pope
has
an
OG
of
1126°
and
each
nip
bottle
has
to
be
laid
down
for
several
years
before
it
is
ready
to
drink

Gales
of
Horndean
brew
a
Prize
Old
Ale

Knowing
the
body
count

The
strength
of
beer
is
shown
in
two
ways
the
original
gravity
and
the
alcohol
by
volume
rating

Original
gravity
OG
is
not
strictly
an
indication
of
strength
but
is
the
measurement
taken
by
excise
officers
at
the
start
of
the
fermentation
process
to
see
how
much
sugar
is
present
in
the
brew

Brewers
pay
tax
excise
duty
on
the
gravity

Water
has
a
gravity
of
1000
degrees

If
36
parts
of
fermentable
material
are
added
to
water
a
beer
will
be
said
to
have
an
OG
of
1036°

Mild
beers
usually
have
OGs
of
1030–1036°
bitters
1034–1039°
special
bitters
1040–1048°
and
strong
ales
anything
from
1050
to
1100°

Stouts
usually
have
gravities
in
the
middle
1040s

Brewers
are
now
introducing
the
Alcohol
by
Volume
rating
system

The
ABV
of
a
beer
may
be
similar
to
its
OG
for
example
3.6%
ABV
and
1036%degree
OG
but
the
ABV
can
be
higher
or
lower
than
the
OG
according
to
the
amount
of
sugar
left
in
the
finished
beer

It
is
likely
that
the
present
system
of
paying
duty
on
the
OG
will
be
phased
out
and
Britain
will
adopt
the
European
method
of
paying
tax
when
the
beer
leaves
the
brewery

Tackling
the
power
of
the
barons
of
beer

There
are
fewer
breweries
operating
in
Britain
today
than
when
CAMRA
began

It
is
equally
true
that
there
would
be
even
fewer
breweries
left
if
the
Campaign
had
not
opposed
takeovers
and
mergers
vociferously

The
history
of
the
past
30
years
in
brewing
has
been
dominated
by
the
emergence
of
a
handful
of
giant
national
companies
Bass
Allied
Whitbread
GrandMet/Watney
Courage
and
Scottish
Newcastle
driven
by
a
need
to
maximise
profit
rather
than
concentrating
on
high
quality
products
that
also
generate
a
good
return

The
nationals
control
the
bulk
of
production

They
supply
most
of
the
pubs
and
they
distort
the
market
as
a
result
of
their
sheer
size
and
advertising
wealth

The
national
brewers
'
leverage
has
been
intensified
as
a
result
of
the
rise
of
lager

The
growth
has
been
fuelled
by
massive
promotions
with
the
brewers
spending
some
70
per
cent
of
their
promotional
budgets
on
the
fake
Euro
brands

Many
smaller
brewers
do
not
have
the
capital
to
invest
in
lager
production
lines
and
buy
their
lagers
from
the
nationals
including
Guinness
's
Harp
subsidiary

The
national
brewers
account
for
more
than
90
per
cent
of
total
lager
production

An
investigation
by
the
Monopolies
and
Mergers
Commission
on
the
supply
of
beer
appeared
in
1989
and
in
the
main
agreed
with
CAMRA
that
a
monopoly
existed
as
a
result
of
the
complex
vertical
and
horizontal
grip
of
the
nationals

They
brew
around
75
per
cent
of
all
beer
control
a
majority
of
tied
pubs
and
dominate
the
free
trade
through
cheap
loans
and
other
backhanders

The
MMC
's
radical
proposals
included
a
demand
that
the
nationals
should
collectively
sell
off
22,000
pubs
loan
ties
should
be
banned
and
all
tenants
should
be
free
to
buy
beers
free
of
the
tie

After
much
huffing
and
puffing
the
government
backed
down
from
implementing
most
of
these
proposals

The
only
small
crumb
of
comfort
is
that
since
May
1990
tenants
but
not
managers
of
national
brewers
'
pubs
can
buy
guest
cask
ales
free
of
the
tie
but
the
nationals
have
been
quick
to
dominate
this
new
market
niche
by
organising
their
own
lists
of
guest
beers
many
of
them
brewed
by
their
own
subsidiaries

By
1992
brewers
with
more
than
2,000
pubs
will
have
to
turn
half
of
them
above
the
2,000
ceiling
into
quasi
free
houses

But
they
can
still
be
loan-tied
which
means
the
nationals
will
still
effectively
control
these
outlets

Nevertheless
S&amp;N
has
sold
pubs
to
bring
the
group
below
the
2,000
ceiling
and
Grand
Met
has
sold
its
breweries

Another
disturbing
trend
is
the
drift
of
large
regional
companies
out
of
brewing

Boddingtons
and
Greenall
Whitley
have
both
sold
their
breweries

Their
beers
are
now
brewed
by
Whitbread
and
Allied
intensifying
the
grip
of
the
nationals

On
the
positive
side
CAMRA
can
point
to
the
success
of
the
independent
brewers
many
of
whom
would
not
exist
today
but
for
the
interest
in
cask
ale
generated
by
the
Campaign

They
have
been
joined
by
a
host
of
small
micro
brewers
producing
a
limited
barrelage
but
adding
variety
and
choice
in
the
genuine
free
trade

With
little
promotional
support
cask
ale
sales
are
rising
and
now
account
for
20
per
cent
of
the
total
beer
market

There
is
still
a
great
deal
for
CAMRA
to
do
to
ensure
that
a
wide-ranging
and
diversified
brewing
industry
survives
into
the
20th
century

But
we
can
take
heart
from
the
fact
that
apart
from
Germany
Britain
enjoys
the
greatest
choice
and
variety
of
beers
in
Europe

Grassroots
key
to
success

The
Campaign
's
policy-making
forum
and
driving
force
is
the
annual
general
meeting

It
votes
on
policies
for
the
ensuing
year
and
elects
a
National
Executive
which
is
also
a
board
of
directors
for
CAMRA
is
a
company
limited
by

The
Campaign
has
branches
throughout
the
country
which
organise
regular
meetings
social
activities
and
brewery
trips
and
also
monitor
any
changes
in
local
breweries
and
their
beers

Branches
produce
newsletters
local
beer
and
pubs
guides
and
run
beer
festivals

The
branches
are
organised
into
regions

Each
region
has
a
director
and
all
the
regional
directors
meet
together
as
the
Branches
Committee

This
looks
after
the
day-to-day
running
of
the
Campaign
leaving
the
executive
to
consider
major
policy
initiatives

The
executive
has
a
number
of
committees
and
policy
groups
that
take
on
special
responsibilities

The
Finance
Committee
takes
detailed
control
of
the
Campaign
's
income
and
expenditure
and
organised
the
buying
of
the
Campaign
's
head
office
in
St
Albans

The
Economics
and
Industry
Group
has
a
watching
brief
on
the
state
of
the
brewing
industry

Over
the
years
it
has
produced
a
wide-ranging
series
of
reports
on
abuses
of
power
by
the
national
brewers
many
of
which
have
led
to
action
by
central
government

The
EIG
was
at
the
centre
of
CAMRA
's
response
to
the
Monopolies
and
Mergers
Commission

The
Strategies
and
Promotions
Group
takes
the
policy
decisions
of
the
AGM
and
organises
their
implementation

It
uses
the
best
talents
available
to
produce
promotional
materials
to
recruit
new
members

It
also
controls
the
publication
of

books
and

looks
at
all
aspects
of

It
monitors
new
developments
in

and
reports
on
such
matters
as

organise
the
influential
annual
Great
British

the
biggest
festival
in

The
strength
of
CAMRA
lies
in
the
voluntary
nature
of
the
organisation
and
the
commitment
of
the
members

But
30,000
members
need
full-time
professional
support
too

The
St

has
a
full-time
staff
including
a

the
running
of

Do
you

enjoy
a

of
traditional

like
the
relaxed
atmosphere
of
a
good
pub

believe
that
beer
drinkers
deserve
a

deal

If
so
then
read
on
you
're

Traditional
beer
and
pubs
have
been
under
threat
for
decades
and
remain
so
today

CAMRA
the
Campaign
for
Real
Ale
exists
to
combat
these
threats

It
has
been
called
Europe
's
most
successful
consumer
movement

CAMRA
saved
traditional
British
beer
which
the
brewers
wanted
to
do
away
with

It
has
saved
some
breweries
from
takeover
and
encouraged
new
ones
to
open

It
has
persuaded
pubs
to
open
during
the
afternoon
and
provide
an
additional
beer
from
a
different
brewery
through
successful
lobbying
of
Parliament

CAMRA
is
campaigning
to
save
traditional
Cider
and
Perry
from
extinction

BUT
the
drinker
's
struggle
is
far
from
over

why
is
beer
30p
a
pint
cheaper
in
Manchester
than
in
London

do
you
know
what
goes
into
your

Why
can
we
not
be
told

why
are
we
losing
the
heritage
of
so
many
traditional
